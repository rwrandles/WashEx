# This repository contains code and data for the Washington State Legislative Explorer Project #

## *Setup*

`R` packages:

  * httr
  * XML
  * dplyr
  * tidyr
  * DBI
  * RSQLite
  * lubridate
  * zoo
  * snakecase

## *Data availability*

The current version as of 10/4/2019 contains complete data for all legislation, sponsors, committees, and legislative activity for the 2013-14, 2015-16, and 2017-18 congresses.

## *Files*

The project is divded among four `R` scripts, currently named `WashEx-source-functions.R`, `step1.R`, `step2.R`, and `step3.R`. Each of the first two scripts has an associated CSV file that is generated by the file and is used to handle manual data input. The process currently works as follows:

0.) `WashEx-source-functions.R` contains the functions necessary for scraping and processing data from the API

1.) `step1.R` will scrape data for committees and sponsors. It will then generate a CSV file of "mismatching districts"; these are districts containing either more than two representatives or more than one senator. This indicates that there was a potential seat change during the term.

2.) `step1.csv` contains a list of each sponsor in a mismatched district. Manual input is used to enter the start and end dates for representatives _only_ if they moved during that term. All others are left blank

3.) `step2.R` uses the CSV data to update the termStart and termEnd values for all legislators. This file then scrapes all bill and action-related data and parses the actions in location IDs. It finally generates a blank CSV to allow for manual committee reassignments.

4.) `step2.csv` is used to manually reassign committees. For example, the 2017 legislature had a Labor & Commerce committee, while the name changed to Commerce, Labor & Sports in 2018.

5.) `step3.R` takes the manual input from the CSV and adjusts the location IDs in the action table to reassign locations. It then finishes by processing legislative sessions, and updating information about referrals and primary sponsor characteristics in the bill table. All data is packaged into `WashEx-db.sqlite`.

## *Data Architecture*

The current version as of 10/4/2019 contains an SQLite database named `WashEx-db.sqlite`, which contains all of the data scraped and processed from the Washington State Legislature's [legislative services API](http://wslwebservices.leg.wa.gov) that is implemented in the project. Below is a description of the contents and architecture of the database.

## *Accessory Files*

There are five accessory data files included in the project. These are listed below

* `commLeaders.csv:` contains information for each legislator and whether they are the chair or vice-chair of a particular committee
* `legMajorities.csv:` contiains the majority party for each year in both the House and Senate
* `sessDates.csv:` contains start and end dates for all regular and special sessions in each biennium
* `sponsor_gender.csv:` contains a binary variable for the gender of each legislator
* `WAgov.csv:` contains general demographic information for the governor for each year

## *Database Tables*

* Legislation: contains summary information on each piece of legislation
* Sponsors: contains identifying and demographic information on individual legislators
* Committees: contains information on legislative commitees and their active status
* Actions: contains information on legislative actions carried out on bills throughout their lifetime
